        <p class="inform">When traveling to Prince Edward Island, flying is definitly an option, as to get there quicker. But, if you drive, you get to see things along the way that you wouldn't get to see if you flew. Also, getting to drive on <em><Strong>Confederation Bridge, built in 1999 to connect the mainland to Prince Edward Island,</strong></em> is a experince you'll never see if you fly. Spending a good <em><Strong>10-20 minutes</strong></em> on the bridge, you'll be suspended over the bay connecting to the Atlantic Ocean. All while seeing the island in the distance.</p>
